# Kano
A CHIP-8 Emulator

A basic CHIP-8 emulator I developed in my spare time.
It does not currently support any MegaChip or SuperChip operations.  As such, no software developed which uses these operations will work correctly.

This is something I developed on my own in about a couple weeks, and it is my first emulator.  Expect messy, unorganized code.  I hope to correct some of this in the near future.
